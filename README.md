# week-4-game
##Introduction
For this PRG Game I decided to go a different route from the assignment. I decided to make a more robust RPG with more internal logic. I wanted to replicate the dice based system of DnD and the turn based combat of Pokemon.

The list of features I want for this game is pretty extensive so right now I have to do some scope controll. Originally I wanted to put in a character customization and several classes. I also wanted an inventory system and weapons system. I think these are all things I can implement down the line. Right now I want the core game elements as a PoC to see if this game is even fun. 

##Goals
For this project I wanted to create it entirely OOP. I have not done this with JS before so it will be very interesting to see how well it turns out. Right now I am still trying to figure out how classes work in JS and how to use Prototypes. These are all things I'm getting tremedous practice with while building this game. 

I feel like I need to give myself a date to end building the engine. 

##Icons
Found this awesome RPG Icon pack here:

Definitely really cool, I had no idea what IcoMoon is. Definitely will check them out later.
